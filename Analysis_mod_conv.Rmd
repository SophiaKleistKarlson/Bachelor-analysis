Mod 2: conventionality


```{r}
# set working directory
setwd("~/Social Transmission Study/Analysis of drawings/")

# load necesary packages through pacman
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, brms, ggplot2, stringr, dplyr)

# RStudio version
RStudio.Version()

# read data and delete the first unnecessary column
data_conv <- read_csv("data/csv_files/all_data_w_all_conv_source.csv") #we use all_data_w_all_conv_source.csv
data_conv$X1 <- NULL

```

Preparing the data and checking stuff
```{r}
# Checking classes

# Generation, complexity, conventionality and confidence should be numeric
class(data_conv$Generation)
class(data_conv$Confidence)
class(data_conv$Conventionality)

# Subject and Drawing ID should be character
class(data_conv$Subject)
class(data_conv$Drawing_ID)

# Chain, condition and Source_image should be factors
class(data_conv$Chain)
class(data_conv$Condition)
class(data_conv$Source_image)

data_conv$Chain <- as.factor(data_conv$Chain)
data_conv$Condition <- as.factor(data_conv$Condition)
data_conv$Source_image <- as.factor(data_conv$Source_image)


# Chose the variables needed for the model
df_conventionality <- data_conv %>% select(Subject, Chain, Generation, Condition, Source_image, Conventionality)

```


Ideal model: 

Complexity ~ 1 + Condition*Generation +
  (1 + condition*generation | Source_image) +
  (1 + condition*generation | Subject:Chain) +
  (1 + condition*generation | Chain)



Modeling
```{r}

#class(df_conventionality$Generation)
#df_conventionality$Generation <- as.character(df_conventionality$Generation)
#df_conventionality$Generation <- as.numeric(df_conventionality$Generation)

# Set seed so that the analysis can be re-run and give the same results
set.seed(555)


# Define the model
convention_mod <- bf(Conventionality ~ 0 + mo(Generation) + Condition + mo(Generation):Condition + 
                       (0 + Condition | gr(Subject, by=Generation)))#by=gr(mo(Generation, by=Chain))))+
                       #(0 + mo(Generation) + Condition + mo(Generation):Condition | Source_image))



# Figure out what priors we'll need
get_prior(convention_mod, family = gaussian, df_conventionality)

# Checking range, mean and standard deviation of complexity, to determine which family to choose and to use for beta- and intercept-priors
range(df_conventionality$Conventionality)
mean(df_conventionality$Conventionality)
sd(df_conventionality$Conventionality)

# For choosing the sd prior - GROUP BY DRAWING AND NOT SUBJECT???
df_subj <- df_conventionality %>% group_by(Subject) %>% summarize(conv_mean = mean(Conventionality)) #find mean complexity for each participant
sd(df_subj$conv_mean)#get the standard deviation of the mean complexity for each participant (0.2970962). Divide this in two (0.1485481)


df_source <- df_conventionality %>% group_by(Source_image) %>% summarize(conv_mean = mean(Conventionality)) #find mean

#mean: 0 (I expect that they might not vary at all). sd for the mean conv for each dubject = 0.30. sigma should go from 0 (the mean of the prior) to around that -> sigma: 0.15.
  #prior(dirichlet(rep(1, 7)),        class = simo)# mean is 1 for a uniform prior, sigma is K-1, where K is the number of levels in the monotonic variable (we have 8 generations)
