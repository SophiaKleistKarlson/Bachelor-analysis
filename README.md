Code for the preprocessing and statistical analysis for my bachelor project


The scripts should be run in the following order (scripts 1-6 are found in the preprocessing folder):

1: Preprocessing_script

2: unique_drawing_IDs

3: Image_preprocessing_script

4: Preprocessing_conv_comp

5: similarity_all

6: Preprocessing_MSE

7: Plotting_and_inspecting_data

8: Analysis_mod_comp

9: Analysis_mod_conv

10: Analysis_mod_MSE

11: interclass_correlation_coefficient

NB: For replicating the analysis without the original data, please go to https://github.com/SophiaKleistKarlson/CDS-final-project where partially preprocessed data can be found (not containing personal information of the participants).
